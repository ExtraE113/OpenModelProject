                            <p>Surveys only capture a sample of the population, so we know that the result probably
                                won’t exactly match the “true” result that we would get if we surveyed everyone in the
                                population or that we would expect to see on election day.</p>
                            <p>Without adjustment, surveys tend to over represent people who are easier to reach and
                                underrepresent those types of people who are harder to reach. In order to make the
                                results more representative we weight the data so that it matches the population – based
                                on a number of demographic measures. Weighting is a crucial step for avoiding biased
                                results, but it also has the effect of making the margin of error larger. Using US
                                Census data, we can get a rough sense of the proportions of gender, race, and age we
                                would expect to see in our sample.</p>

                                deciding not to vote still show up in our survey sample. To resolve this, we create a
