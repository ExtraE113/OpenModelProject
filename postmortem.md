We modeled and polled the January 2021 Georgia runoffs, and we did some things well and some things not-so-well. We'll
have more coming soon, but for now you can [listen to our latest podcast episode](/#podcast), [read our methodology](
/Modeling the Georgia Senate Runoff Elections - Model Methodology.pdf) or play with the model and see the error change
[here](/model-archive).
