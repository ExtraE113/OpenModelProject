Tad Mrozek is a high-school senior and part of the successful Oracle of Blair team that got the attention of
FiveThirtyEight and the Center for Politics. They have been interested in politics since the 2016 election, worked on
Maryland Governor Larry Hogan's re-election campaign, and was one of the most accurate predictors in 2020. They intend
to study political science in college, and believe that everything can be solved with enough time and enough data.
